From game day to Sunday school to dinner with friends, these plaid dresses will be the perfect ensemble for any event you'll be attending this fall. "

            "We're always on the lookout for pretty houseplants with eye-catching foliage. Some of our favorites are calatheas (pronounced \"cah-lay-thee-ahs\"), also known as prayer plants, which are able to thrive indoors with minimal maintenance. They do best in bright, indirect light, but they can also handle low-light scenarios. We've rounded up a few of our favorites below along with some growing tips, including why you should give calatheas a spay day every once in a while. When talking about calatheas, the first question everyone asks is\u2026",
            "Calatheas are also called prayer plants because of the movements of their leaves. During the day and night, calathea leaves noticeably lift and dip in a circadian rhythm. During the day, a calathea will have leaves stretching out horizontally from their stems. Check on it at night, and you will likely see the calathea's leaves standing straight up. They like to move! Different varieties have different characteristics, so you should take care when you\u2026",
            "Finding the best calathea for you comes down to the conditions of your space. Some of the most popular and easy to grow are Calathea ornata, a variety that has glossy, deep green leaves with pink or white pinstripes. It's also called pinstripe plant. Calathea orbifolia has luminous, bright green leaves with lighter green stripes across the surface. Calathea lancifolia is also known as rattlesnake plant because of the striking patterns of its leaves. Each has its own care requirements, so study their needs and decide which varieties might grow well in your home. After you choose the calathea that speaks to you-and is best for your space-there are a few steps to take to\u2026",
            "Calatheas like medium to bright indirect light, however if all they receive is low light, they can often adapt and tolerate that condition too. They don't need frequent watering. It's recommended to water calatheas every 1-2 weeks at most. It's important to allow the soil to dry out between waterings to keep the plants from becoming waterlogged. They also love humidity, which is why you should\u2026",
            "Calatheas love humidity, and they're known to thrive in spaces with humid conditions. You can place them in humid areas in your home, or you can give them the occasional spa day. It might sound strange, but its recommended that you bring your calatheas into the bathroom when you shower so that they can soak in an approximation of tropical conditions.",

There's a reason every garden store has piles of mums for purchase during the autumn months, and it's because everyone and their sister buys pots of the yellow, orange, and red blooms for their porches and entryways. If you'd like to try something new and branch out into the broader world of fall flowers, check out fall-blooming asters, a fresh alternative to mums.",
            "There are lots of asters to choose from come late summer and fall, and they also have a wide shade range. According to The New Southern Living Garden Book, \"The flowers come in white or shades of blue, red, pink, lavender, or purple, mostly with yellow centers; they bloom in late summer to early fall.\" When you plant asters, they'll require full sun and regular to moderate water, depending on the climate. While they work in pots, you can easily treat them as perennials, which will allow you to look forward to their blooms year after year.",
            "One of the last asters to bloom in autumn is aromatic aster (Symphyotrichum oblongifolium, Aster oblongifolius). It's native to the South, particularly in places like Missouri and Kentucky, and grows to 24 inches tall, sending its fragrance out and its purple, blue, or pink blooms up into the air. It's lovely grown in pots but can also be used in beds and edging.",
            "For planting ideas, turn to The New Southern Living Garden Book, which says, \"Taller asters are invaluable for abundant color in large borders or among shrubs. Large sprays are effective in arrangements. Compact dwarf or cushion types make tidy edgings, mounds of color in rock gardens, good container plants.\" Plant a few pots this season to add a bit of difference in your autumn decor. ",
