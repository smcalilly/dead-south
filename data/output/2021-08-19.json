            "The next time you're walking through the aisles of your local Lowe's, picking up paint rollers, picture hanging kits, and refills for your hot glue gun, be aware that you're walking through history. The home improvement giant started right here in the South over 100 years ago.",
            "The Lowe's story began in North Carolina when Wilkes County farmer L.S. Lowe decided to start his own store, opening Lowe's North Wilkesboro Hardware in 1921. The little shop downtown on C Street sold hardware and building materials alongside sewing notions, dry goods, horse tack, snuff produce and groceries, Our State notes. Lowe was content selling his bric-a-brac to the local community, passing the family business to his daughter, Ruth, and his son, Jim Lowe, in 1940. While Jim Lowe and Ruth's husband Carl Buchan, were off serving in WWII, Ruth and her mother, Floy Elizabeth Lowe,\u00a0kept the lights on at the store.",
            "Buchan \"was given an honorable discharge after suffering a foot injury in 1943,\" according to Our State. Back at home, he needed a job and Lowe, still in the Army, made him an offer, do an inventory of everything in the store and, if he paid Lowe \"the equivalent amount in cash, the two would be 50-50 partners.\" Per Our State, \"the inventory amounted to about $12,500\". Buchan bought in to the business and soon things really took off.",
            "According to the Lowe's history on the company's website, Buchan realized that when the war was over, soldiers would be returning home, starting families, and needing houses. Anticipating the impending building boom, Buchan decided that the store should focus solely on home improvement products\u2014anything a person might need to build, repair, or gussy up a house. The idea was a hit and, come 1949, they opened a second Lowe's in Sparta, N.C.",
            "Buchan was a business visionary and soon took over the whole family business. It may have made for some awkward Lowe family suppers, but Buchan kept the store name and set about growing the business. Jim Lowe had his own vision, including starting the\u00a0Lowes Foods\u00a0supermarket chain.\u00a0Soon Lowe's, the home improvement store, had over 300 employees and a bustling trade selling supplies to pros as well as DIYers.",
            "Come October 1961, Lowe's was a publicly-traded company on the brink of serving one million customers a year\u2014a milestone they hit in 1964. Fast forward to 1982 and Lowe's had its first billion-dollar sales year. Lowe's opened its first stores in Canada in December 2007 and started selling building supplies in Mexico in February 2010.",

            " Buchan bought a half share of the store with a $2,000 loan and has always been running Lowe & Eagle ever since (messing around with pencils on the job). Eventually he opened next door, Pro Framer and then next to that, Framer's Paradise. Buchan also started what became Center Point Printing, helping make Archer, who he met while stationed in France during WWII, \"the world's leading paper and envelope manufacturer",

A few months into living here, around the same time that I pledged loyalty to mayonnaise-based barbecue sauce and the Crimson Tide, I learned what the locals already knew: the Pants Store does, in fact, sell more than pants.",

They also sell an assortment of other sundries, like stainless steel water bottles and satin pillowcases, and carry an impressive lineup of game-day gear, like branded polo shirts and stadium-approved clear purses.",

            "This friendly town on the Chesapeake Bay feels a bit like Mayberry. Here on the southern end of Virginia's Eastern Shore, kids shuffle down the pier with fishing poles and Cokes, wispy-haired men swap stories outside the hardware store, and the whole place seems to tuck in for the night not long after the sun goes down. But Cape Charles is decidedly more cosmopolitan than Andy Griffith's stomping grounds. Just east of the hardware store is Hotel Cape Charles, a sleek boutique stay that offers complimentary beach cruisers for guests. Across the street is Cape Charles Distillery, where they pour elevated cocktails crafted with locally made spirits.",
            "Once the economic hub of the Eastern Shore, Cape Charles settled into a sleepier routine with the decline of the railroad industry and the opening of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel. But more than 50 years later, the salty little hamlet has officially made a comeback, holding tight to its small-town character even as it welcomes a new and growing crowd of beach lovers. Now meet the folks who are ushering Cape Charles into its most exciting chapter yet.",
            "Carol and Beth Ann SaboThe Sabo sisters are not very good at retirement. \"The joke on the Shore is that everybody has two jobs,\" says Beth Ann. \"We already had second jobs (I train dogs, and Carol owns Machipongo Trading Company up the road) when we had careers. Once we retired from our full-time gigs as an equine vet and forensic scientist, we just needed another thing to fill the career space.\" They did that with coffee, bagels, and new and gently used books. In November 2018, they opened Peach Street Books in a light-filled 1930s building that had been a Pure Oil station and then a garage. \"We love the feeling here,\" says Beth Ann of the cottage-meets-contemporary space. \"We knew from the plans what it would look like but not what it would feel like\u2014welcoming and cheery. It has historic angles but is still modern, which is very much like Cape Charles itself.\" For the sisters, the bookstore is a means of connecting with each other, their neighbors, and anyone else who meanders onto this stretch of the Eastern Shore. \"When you go into a town and see that there are other people who love books and reading or writing, it just gives you a good feeling of community,\" says Beth Ann. \"It makes the world seem both smaller and larger at the same time.\"",
            "Mark and Chris MarshallThe siblings and business partners are near-perfect foils for each other. Mark, the self-proclaimed \"serious brother,\" wears a collared shirt and wiry glasses. He talks about things like the town's old \"cash economy.\" Chris, aka \"fun brother,\" looks more like a surfer than a sales guy and wears a T-shirt he tie-dyed himself. But that's probably why the two work well together\u2014and also why their Cape Charles Brewing Company is enjoying so much success. \"We wanted to create a true destination: a place where you could have a great craft beer, eat good food, and listen to music,\" says Mark. For Chris, the proof that they had done just that was parked right outside\u2014at least before the coronavirus pandemic. He pulled into the brewery parking lot one day to find license plates from all over: Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York. Now, as people begin to feel safer and more comfortable traveling, the brothers hope to see a full lot again this summer. \"You have this pristine piece of geography here,\" says Mark. \"It's a little slice of paradise that everybody is finding out about and coming down to discover.\"",

Let's see what's on the other side.' \" There, they found Cape Charles, a quiet bayside haven. Totally smitten with this place, they closed on a house just 15 days later\u2014something that Miriam says is not altogether unusual for the area. \"That's the story of so many people who live here,\" she says. \"They come, they fall in love with it, and they buy something.\" That was in 2005. Then, seven years later, Miriam found herself with another piece of real estate\u2014a rented retail space on Mason Avenue, the town's main drag\u2014and no idea what to do with it. \"I thought, 'What does a beach town really need?' \" So then she opened Brown Dog Ice Cream, where the tasty flavors are determined by what's in season and what's available just down the road. \"The old adage, 'A rising tide lifts all boats,' is very true here,\" says Miriam. \"To make our coffee ice cream, we source from the local roaster. All the farmers come and bring me the produce that is freshest to use. If I find myself needing more peaches, they will let me go pick them.\" While the menu (which features coffee and doughnuts in addition to its inventive ice creams) changes daily, the welcoming atmosphere at the shop and across Cape Charles in general remains a constant. \"There is a sense of community here, even if you're just visiting this area,\" says Miriam. \"People will come and stay for a week. By the second day, we've talked to them and know who they are. And by the end of the week, they will come in and tell us, 'We're really sorry that it's our last day, but we'll be back next year.' \"",

            "Fans of baseball, Kevin Costner, and the 1989 film Field of Dreams, hit a triple when Major League Baseball held its long-anticipated Field of Dreams\u00a0game. Inspired by the movie (which in turn an adaptation of W.P. Kinsella's novel Shoeless Joe) a temporary stadium was built near the site where the film was shot, the players dressed in retro uniforms, emerging from the corn fields to play a game to remember.",
            "While fans were gathered in Dyersville, Iowa, to see the nostalgia-fueled face-off between the Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees, one of the match's highlights had nothing to do with professional sports, but a game of catch between father and son. During the game, Kevin Costner, who played Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella, who built a baseball field in his cornfield, threw the ball around with his real-life son, Joe Costner. It made the trip down memory lane even more special for the star.",
            "\"Last week the\u00a0@mlb\u00a0gave me a chance to \"have a catch\" with my son at the Field of Dreams,\" Costner wrote in a caption to his Instagram post. \"Joe was just a baby when we made Field of Dreams\u2014a movie ultimately about the relationship between a father and son. It felt completely full circle to share this incredible experience with him.\"\u00a0",
