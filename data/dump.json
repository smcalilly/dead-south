And while he could talk to you 'til the cows come home about epicurean delights, today he wants to shift our attention to food waste. A dire issue, Zimmern recently partnered with grocery store chain Aldi to raise awareness about the problem and share some of his top tips for reducing food waste. Below, he revealed his top tips with us — and we think they're all game-changers worth following. Join us?", "1. Buy a smaller fridge (or reduce the capacity of the one you have by removing a shelf or drawer).", "Yes, we're looking at you, double-doored, Sally. \"[People should] make their fridge smaller and shop twice a week and the first one makes the second one a necessity. The American refrigerators are so big they're built on American convenience culture. They want us to shop once a week and then when 'mealus interruptus' happens, and it happens to everyone, we wind up throwing out food on Sunday that we bought the Monday beforehand,\" said Zimmern. \"Meal planning is really important, but even more important is to shrink your fridge. I bought a small European refrigerator, and it was the best thing I ever did,\" he continued, adding that if you have a big American fridge simply remove a drawer and take out a shelf for two weeks and see how it goes. ", "2. Put a notepad and a pen on the counter next to the garbage can and write down all food that you put in the trash.", "\"Even if it's that bag that holds the bunches of grapes and there's a cup of loosies at the bottom and they're just bruised and rotted, write that down. At the end of the two weeks, you'll see the patterns,\" said Zimmern. \"I have a friend that wastes a lot of food, and fascinatingly I got him to write everything down. There was one item that every night was on his list, and it just said, 'half a salad bowl.' I asked him about it and was like, 'what do you mean like your own bowl of salad?' He was like, 'you know there's five people in our family, we like a big salad every night, we have this big salad bowl. We cut all this lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and carrots, and then we throw it in there, and we dress it with oil and vinegar and lemon juice, everyone's favorite dressing, a little bit of salt, herbs, and mustard and made this great vinaigrette. We only eat half of it, and then it's wilted by the time we clear the table, and we throw it away,'\" Zimmern recounted. \"I said 'don't throw it away, put it in a bag or a container, and the next morning instead of having pancakes one or two people can have a healthy blended salad as all or part of their breakfast. You won't throw it away and save a meal or two every day depending on the size.'\" Little changes can go a long way, y'all.", "Chronic fruit-tosser? Put old fruit in your freezer before it becomes unusable and repurpose it. \"Before it gets bruised and rotten, and you throw it away, do what we do for bananas with banana bread, throw it in the freezer. Then roast it, turn it into sauces, purée it, turn it into freezer jams, but if you don't write it down you won't know what your trends are,\" shared Zimmern.", "3. Stop stocking up on excessive amounts of pantry ingredients.", "Really. Just hear him out. \"People wind up buying so many things they don't need or are only going to need once, and then they forget to use it up. A great example is someone will decide that they want to make some wonderful Thai dish, and they'll buy some sweet Thai sticky rice, and they soak it overnight, and they steam it for a couple of hours, and it's wonderful and then that rice just sits on the shelf for two years,\" commented Zimmern. \"Then they go into it again and, you know, there's little bugs or something crawled in there, or it drops and spills or someone says, 'oh it's been there for two years, let's get rid of it.' I encourage people, buy less. When I buy a five-pound bag of Thai sticky rice, do I eat it every night? No, but I make a concerted effort every week to cook a dish and use the Tai sticky rice in it. That's good menu planning,\" he said, noting that we should all observe the FIFO principle, — or \"first-in, first out\"— making sure that we use up items that we opened or bought first before moving on to another item (say, that half-opened jar of medium salsa should be used up before you open up a jar of spicy salsa).

The prerequisite to adhering to the dress code? Well, understanding the dress code. From black tie to casual, we're here with an easy-to-follow guide to the top 5 wedding guest dress codes that you'll most commonly see on the lace-adorned invitations. Because there's no time to stress when merriment and a celebration of love is to be had. Here's how to dress confidently for your next wedding. ", "White tie: There aren't many times in life when this dress code will be required of you, unless you're attending a royal wedding, perhaps? White tie attire is the most formal dress code and typically calls for floor-length gowns for the ladies and a black dress coat with tails and matching pants for men, as well as a white bow tie and gloves. White tie attire has been around for a long time, but is pretty uncommon for modern weddings.", "Black tie: This is the most familiar formal dress code. Gents should dress in full tuxedos (possibly substituting a white dinner jacket in the warmer months), and the ladies should wear either elegant floor-length gowns or their most formal cocktail dresses. Since many of us don't have closets full of evening gowns at our disposal, this is the perfect time to consider using Rent the Runway to find hundreds of gowns for rent. Pull out your best jewelry, and don't be afraid to pop a red lip! ", "Black tie optional: This type of wedding is also referred to as simply \"formal.\" As the name suggests, it allows a bit more flexibility than a black tie dress code. Men can wear tuxedos or formal dark suits, and women can wear anything from evening gowns to dressy cocktail attire. Want to straddle the line? Choose a long dress with a bit less structure and more color than a black tie wedding would require. Basically, you can get a little more fun with it. ", "Semi-formal: Also known as \"cocktail,\" this is one of the most popular dress codes, and for good reason. It fits in with almost any wedding venue and is relatively easy for guests to abide by. A semi-formal dress code calls for suits for the men and cocktail dresses for the ladies. Since many women have a favorite go-to cocktail dress — little black dress, anyone? — it's a fabulous idea to wear the same dress for multiple events, paired with completely different accessories. You can also employ sneaky beauty tweaks, such as changing up from hair down to an updo, or a smoky eye to a bright lip color! ", "Casual: Likely the invitation will say, \"dressy casual.\" (Don't get our style editor started on how confusing that term can be for guests.) Going to a beach, farm, or very intimate wedding? There's a good chance the dress code will be casual, but that doesn't mean jeans and tank tops are acceptable — unless otherwise specified, of course. We suggest at least a dress shirt and dress pants or khakis for the gentlemen, and a pretty sundress and wedges or sandals for the ladies.", "Our last handy rules of thumb for all of the above dress codes? First, avoid wearing anything that is more than 50 percent white. Don't want to upstage the bride! Second, keep attire guidelines for ceremonies at houses of worship in mind. Third, some invitations might recommend dressing \"festive\" or (in cases of tropical weddings and the like) \"on theme,\" which might mean to break out the bright colors and bold accessories in addition to adhering to cocktail attire.
